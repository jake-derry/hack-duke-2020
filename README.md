# HackDuke 2020 Propel Education: Connecting students with guidance counselors. 

### Description
**Project Name:** Propel Education. Our web application serves as a platform where students can enter their goals, and counselors can seamlessly track them. This will empower counselors to more effectively support individual student situations. <br>
**Team Members:** Enter team members<br>
**Built With:** Django (backend) and React (frontend) <br>

##### What was our inspiration?
> Many public high schools around the country are overcrowded, and counselors struggle to support a large number of students at once. They do not have the time and resources to track each students progress towards achieving their goals. In fact, counselors often don't know a students individual goals unless a student speaks with a counselor directly. Members of our team went to high schools with over 1000 kids in each grade where forming a personal relationship with counselors is daunting. Furthermore, struggling students at such schools do not have the support they need be monitored and kept on track. Propel Education tackles these important issues in the Education system. Through its platform, students can enter their goals (e.g what colleges they would like to go through, what grades they want in certain classes) using an intuitive interface and mark these goals once complete. On the other end, counselors can monitor the goals for each individual student and track progress efficiently. Counselors can also add/modify goals for students

  - Talk about the development and process of your submission
  - Detail any further work or expansion of your project
  
The problem that I'm considering is the difficult that counselors especially in overcrowded public schools like mine have in supporting their student body. To alleviate this stress, counselors need a better way to determine which students are on track and which students are not on track to achieve their goals. Students will be provided an interface that gives them goals and tasks. These are based on what their long-term goal is (what kind of college they would like to go to, what kind of work they would like to go into). The counselor will have to ability to modify this list to personalize each student's goals based on their situation. Lastly, the school administration will be able to look at analytics on what each student did in school through this platform to identify what's important for getting into college for different groups of students.
