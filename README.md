# HackDuke 2020 Propel Education: Connecting students with guidance counselors. 

### Description
**Project Name:** Propel Education. Ambitious high schoool students need all the support they can get. Our web application serves as a platform where students can enter their goals, and counselors can seamlessly track them. Failiing to plan is planning to failâ€”Propel Education empowers students and counselors to plan together. <br>
**Team Members:** Enter team members<br>
**Built With:** Django (backend) and React (frontend) <br>

### Devpost
##### What track are we submitting to?
> Education
##### What was our inspiration?
> Many public high schools around the country are overcrowded, and counselors struggle to support a large number of students at once. They do not have the time and resources to track each students progress towards achieving their goals. In fact, counselors often don't know a students individual goals unless a student speaks with a counselor directly. Members of our team went to high schools with over 1000 kids in each grade where forming a personal relationship with counselors is daunting. Furthermore, struggling students at such schools do not have the support they need be monitored and kept on track. Propel Education tackles these important issues in the Education system. Goal setting and progress monitoring are critical for high school students who are navigating a challenging time in their lives. 
##### How did we build it?
> We built a Django REST API on the backend that serves calls on the frontend using React. Students and counselors need accounts, and we manage authentification (sign up and log in). Students can enter their goals (e.g what colleges they would like to go through, what grades they want in certain classes) using an intuitive interface and mark these goals once complete. On the other end, counselors can monitor (add/modify) the goals for each individual student and track progress/provide feedback efficiently in real time. Counselors can also assign/customize different tracks based on student performance. School administrations can perform analytics of what students did throughout school to identify personal goals that lead to success for different groups of students.
